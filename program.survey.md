Program surveys

Two people looking at a computer screen
During this certificate program, you may have been asked to complete a few short surveys. These are part of a research study to understand how effective the certificate has been for you. Please see below for a summary of what each survey will cover.

Your survey participation is optional but extremely helpful in making this course as effective as possible. There are no correct answers, and your responses and personal data will:

Not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.

Be kept confidential, with your name separated from your data.

Not be shared outside of our research team, except where you give permission to share contact information with hiring partners.

Thanks for your consideration and time!  

Certificate completion survey
After you complete the last graded assignment in this final course of the certificate, you will be asked to answer a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the program. This survey also asks if you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Both filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is completely optional and will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.

Delayed post survey
Those who successfully complete the full, six-course program will also receive an email follow-up survey six months after their last course to see if their objectives were realized.
