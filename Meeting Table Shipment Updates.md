Meeting Table Shipment Updates
Between Peta PM and Seydou Restaurant consultant 
Peta to confirm the number of devices on the first of the month
ETA one week from order, launch date is scheduled on the very end of the month

shipment of upgraded devices has been delayed by a few? weeks (how few)
this means launch date to be pushed back by at least few weeks 

what are the options based on this scenario?
1. if launch date isn't yet finalized theres an option to push it back so you can launch with the new devices.
2. the current tablet versions are just fine but seydou insist to wait for the upgraded devices since they are bigger and faster.
3. Peta suggest if to use the current version and wait for the upgraded ones later is there no need to re-train the staffs re the interface? If none then Peta to go ahead with the planned launch date.
4. there might be current tablets in the warehouse but their number may not match what is required in the rollout.
5. there are devices available but they are few states away and would take several days 3-4 days to the shipping estimate.
6. Peta said this is much better than few weeks.
7. To replace the current tablets with the upgraded ones will just be a matter of changing the plug and thats it.
8. there's a proposal to ask the vendor Terrific Tablets to agree to swap out the devices at no extra cost.
9. seydou said upgrades come with the contract, so this shouldnt be an issue.
10. for the discount, seydou to check with the vendor sales rep but no guarantees.

takeaway: use the current tablet models that will ship out-of-state warehouse which will take a week and 4 days max. Seydou to confirm how many are available and Peta to place the order.
