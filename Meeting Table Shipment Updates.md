Meeting Table Shipment Updates
Between Peta PM and Seydou Restaurant consultant 
Peta to confirm the number of devices on the first of the month
ETA one week from order, launch date is scheduled on the very end of the month

shipment of upgraded devices has been delayed by a few? weeks (how few)
this means launch date to be pushed back by at least few weeks 

what are the options based on this scenario?
1. if launch date isn't yet finalized theres an option to push it back so you can launch with the new devices.
2. the current tablet versions are just fine but seydou insist to wait for the upgraded devices since they are bigger and faster.
3. Peta suggest if to use the current version and wait for the upgraded ones later is there no need to re-train the staffs re the interface? If none then Peta to go ahead with the planned launch date.
4. there might be current tablets in the warehouse but their number may not match what is required in the rollout.
5. there are devices available but they are few states away and would take several days 3-4 days to the shipping estimate.
6. Peta said this is much better than few weeks.
7. To replace the current tablets with the upgraded ones will just be a matter of changing the plug and thats it.
8. there's a proposal to ask the vendor Terrific Tablets to agree to swap out the devices at no extra cost.
9. seydou said upgrades come with the contract, so this shouldnt be an issue.
10. for the discount, seydou to check with the vendor sales rep but no guarantees.

takeaway: use the current tablet models that will ship out-of-state warehouse which will take a week and 4 days max. Seydou to confirm how many are available and Peta to place the order.

Project Team Meeting Notes
Purpose: Project Tasks Update


5 min: Review new tasks in project plan

5 min: Discuss shipping and installation time estimates: 

**Seydou projected 7-10 days shipping timeline, 3-4 hours to integrate the POS systems**

**Possible need to upgrade the POS system if S&S is running an older version (3-4 days)**

Electrician is confident they can wire both locations in two business days (16 hours), but since we canâ€™t close the restaurants for a full day we need to schedule two half-days at each location

5 min: Discuss menu and coupon upload time estimates:

Still waiting on Carter for the finalized menu and coupon value mock-ups for upload (aiming for one week but could extend to two)

Once mock-ups are received, 3-4 hours to upload

5 min: Discuss training time estimates:

Pre-training meeting to introduce tablets and changes to staff before training them on the tablets (1 hour at each location)

Seydou will train managers first (2 hours), then managers will train all the staff at each location (2 hours for each training plus one hour before and after each training for facilitator prep/debrief)

Gilly and Alex will coordinate with Peta to schedule staff trainings at each of their locations. Each part of the training (pre-training, manager training, staff training) will take place on different days.

**The preparations and planning for the trainings should take about one week.**


15 min: Assess which tasks (or similar tasks) the team has completed before (notes copied from whiteboard):

Team has high level of confidence in the estimates on the Project Plan

NB: table pix of confidence level need to view from coursera exercise page

Tablet Logistics
Task: what is involved with the tablet installation? the tablets will be sending orders to the kitchen via wifi. the electrician is needed to wire up the tables. seydou to contact the tablet vendor to get an electrician in.
task: how will the kitchen be able to update the menus? can be done real time?
seydou reply: yes this is standard feature on all current models. if an item is no longer available you'll be able to update the menu IRT from the admin back-end of the software which can be access on the office PC of the boss in charge. staff training is required to have them know the operation.
task: is seydou be involved in the S&S customization and branding?
seydou: custom branding, design and upload are separate vendor offerings. Terrific Tablets offer these services with some of their packages. if needed by Peta Seydou can connect these services to PMs marketing dept and update the menu interface to match the layout of the menus.
