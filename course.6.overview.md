Course 6 Capstone overview

Hello! Welcome to the capstone course in the Google Project Management Certificate, where you will practice applying the project management knowledge and skills you have learned so far. 

Icons of all six courses with the final course highlighted: Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World
By the end of this course, you will have developed a portfolio of project management artifacts that will demonstrate the skills you have learned throughout the entire program, such as your ability to manage stakeholders and teams, organize plans, and communicate project details. These artifacts can exhibit your career readiness when applying for jobs in the field. To further prepare you to interview for project management jobs, you will reflect on past projects, develop an “elevator pitch,” and anticipate common interview questions. Current Google project managers will continue to instruct and provide you with the strategies, tools, and resources to meet your goals.

If you haven’t taken Courses 1–5 yet, we highly recommend doing so in the order in which they are presented, as they provide the foundation necessary to complete the activities in this course. 

As you progress through this course, you will “observe” a project manager in a real-world scenario and complete dozens of hands-on activities, such as:

analyzing project documents to identify project requirements and evaluate stakeholders 

completing a project charter and using it as a tool to align project scope and goals among stakeholders

identifying tasks and milestones and documenting and prioritizing them in a project plan

defining quality management standards and exploring how to effectively share qualitative data

demonstrating your project’s impact through effective reporting 

About the course
This capstone course covers four weeks of material. Like the previous courses, each week includes a series of lessons with many types of learning opportunities, such as:

Videos with a Google employee as your instructor. 

Readings to introduce new ideas and case studies and to build on the concepts from the videos. 

Discussion forums to explore course topics for better understanding and chat with peers in the program. 

In-video questions that will pop up from time to time. They’re designed for you to check your learning as you go! 

Practice quizzes to check your understanding and give you valuable feedback. Practice activities will provide you with a hands-on opportunity to apply skills you are working to master. You will assess your work by answering quiz questions about it or by comparing it to an exemplar built by our course team. Note: practice activities will not count towards your final course grade, but you are strongly encouraged to complete them as they will help prepare you for the graded quizzes and peer reviews.

Graded quizzes on video and reading content to measure your progress. 

Ungraded peer-review activities on video and reading content  that provide you the opportunity to practice applying skills you are working to master. Other learners in your course will see the work you submit and give you feedback based on a rubric.

Everyone learns differently, so we designed this program to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, they’re just a guide. Feel free to move through the program however it works best for you. Keep in mind, you can always reset your deadlines by clicking the blue reset my deadlines button. There’s no penalty for late assignments. To earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work.

Tips
As mentioned previously, we strongly recommend you take all six courses in the order in which they appear—and complete the items in each lesson— as new information and concepts build on previous ones. 

Make the most of the readings and additional resources throughout the program. They’re designed to support your learning. 

If something is confusing, don’t hesitate to rewatch a video, go through a reading again, or ask your classmates for advice in the discussion forum. 

Take part in all learning opportunities to gain as much knowledge and experience possible.
